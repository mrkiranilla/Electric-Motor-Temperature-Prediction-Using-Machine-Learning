# 🔥 Electric Motor Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 About the Project

This project focuses on predicting the operating temperature of an electric motor using Machine Learning techniques. Electric motors are widely used in industries, and abnormal temperature rise may lead to performance issues or equipment failure.

By analyzing sensor data such as speed, torque, voltage, and current, this system predicts motor temperature to support early fault detection and maintenance planning.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Build ML models to estimate motor temperature
* Reduce the risk of overheating
* Improve operational reliability
* Support predictive maintenance in industrial environments

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Multiple regression models were implemented and evaluated to improve prediction accuracy:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The final selected model is saved and used in the Flask web application for real-time prediction.
